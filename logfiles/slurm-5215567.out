Initializing ResNet
Analyzing data...
Done and results stored for snapshot:  snapshot-150000
Results for 150000  training iterations: 95 1 train error: 1.46 pixels. Test error: 2.17  pixels.
With pcutoff of 0.1  train error: 1.46 pixels. Test error: 2.17 pixels
Thereby, the errors are given by the average distances between the labels by DLC and the scorer.
Plotting...
The network is evaluated and the results are stored in the subdirectory 'evaluation_results'.
If it generalizes well, choose the best model for prediction and update the config file with the appropriate index for the 'snapshotindex'.
Use the function 'analyze_video' to make predictions on new videos.
Otherwise consider retraining the network (see DeepLabCut workflow Fig 2)
