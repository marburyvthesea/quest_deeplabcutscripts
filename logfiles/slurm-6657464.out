Analysis is done and the results are stored (see evaluation-results) for snapshot:  snapshot-300000
Results for 300000  training iterations: 95 1 train error: 1.47 pixels. Test error: 27.66  pixels.
With pcutoff of 0.6  train error: 1.47 pixels. Test error: 4.15 pixels
Thereby, the errors are given by the average distances between the labels by DLC and the scorer.

The network is evaluated and the results are stored in the subdirectory 'evaluation_results'.
Please check the results, then choose the best model (snapshot) for prediction. You can update the config.yaml file with the appropriate index for the 'snapshotindex'.
Use the function 'analyze_video' to make predictions on new videos.
Otherwise, consider adding more labeled-data and retraining the network (see DeepLabCut workflow Fig 2, Nath 2019)
