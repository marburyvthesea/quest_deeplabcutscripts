The training datafile  /projects/p30771/dlc_analysis/rotarod_analysis_00-JJM-2020-02-13/dlc-models/iteration-0/rotarod_analysis_00Feb13-trainset95shuffle1/train/pose_cfg.yaml  is not present.
Probably, the training dataset for this specific shuffle index was not created.
Try with a different shuffle/trainingsetfraction or use function 'create_training_dataset' to create a new trainingdataset with this shuffle index.
